#### Basketball Corpus Linguistic Analysis
The data in my linguistic analysis program is a mix of different articles and movie scripts, all based on <b>'basketball'</b>. These articles are about a range of topics regarding basketball; NBL games, NBA dunk contests, player's biography, fiction movie, predictive reports. Some of these articles I was able to find based on prior knowledge (e.g. Coach Carter is a movie I have watched many times), while some others I gathered through user's comments on a forum known as Reddit, all giving their own contributing vote on their 'favourite NBA articles'. I was able to directly copy and paste the texts from their given webpages which made the task a lot easier. All links are provided below to each text used.
